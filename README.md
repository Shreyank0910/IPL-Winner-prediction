# IPL-Winner-prediction

This project is centered around the Kaggle IPL dataset, a predictive model was meticulously crafted to anticipate the winner of the forthcoming IPL season. The project encompassed the application of a diverse range of machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Neural Network models.<br>



The predictive accuracy was significantly enhanced to an impressive 90% through an iterative process of parameter optimization utilizing advanced methodologies such as GridSearch Cross Validation, Dropouts, and Hyperparameter tuning scripts. This holistic approach not only underscores the project's commitment to extracting meaningful insights from the dataset but also highlights the adeptness in fine-tuning the models to achieve remarkable predictive performance.
