# IPL-Winner-prediction

This project is centered around the Kaggle IPL dataset, a predictive model was meticulously crafted to anticipate the winner of the forthcoming IPL season. The project encompassed the application of a diverse range of machine learning techniques, including <b>Random Forest</b> and <b>Neural Network models</b>.<br>



The predictive accuracy was significantly enhanced to an impressive <b>90%</b> through an iterative process of parameter optimization utilizing advanced methodologies such as <b>GridSearch Cross Validation</b>, <b>Dropouts</b>, and <b>Hyperparameter tuning scripts</b>. This holistic approach not only underscores the project's commitment to extracting meaningful insights from the dataset but also highlights the adeptness in fine-tuning the models to achieve remarkable predictive performance.
